### Implementation

This function takes as input an integer, n, returning a sequence from 1 to n in which multiples of 3 are replaced with 'Fizz', multiples of 5 by 'Buzz', and multiples of 15 by 'FizzBuzz'. Internally, a sequence of integers from 1 to n is assigned to a vector, out. Multiples of 3, 5, and 15 are replaced with text by subsetting with logical vectors, in the process converting out to a character vector. Finally, the vector is concatenated and printed, one element per line.

```{r,echo=T}
FizzBuzz = function(n)
{
  out = seq(n)
  out[(seq(n) %% 3)==0] = 'Fizz'
  out[(seq(n) %% 5)==0] = 'Buzz'
  out[(seq(n) %% 15)==0] = 'FizzBuzz'
  cat(out, sep='\n')
} 
```



### Output

```{r}
FizzBuzz(100)
```
